Click Mephisto's icon to open its popup window and automatically scrape the current page for a chess position to 
analyze. For ease of use, pin Mephisto in chrome's extensions menu. Click the puzzle icon to the right of Chrome's address bar. 
Find "Mephisto Chess Extension" and click the pin icon to the right of it.

You may notice that when you click outside of Mephisto's popup window, the popup will lose focus and close. To prevent
this, right-click the pinned icon and click 'Inspect Popup'.
