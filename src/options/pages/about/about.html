                "Mephisto" is a nod to the 19th-century chess-playing automaton of the same name.
            </p>
            <p>
                During its time, the mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human
                opponent. It's been said that Mephisto never lost a game. It was the first automaton to win a Chess
                tournament when it was entered in the Counties Chess Association in London in 1878.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it was later revealed that Mephisto was, in fact, nothing more than an elaborate illusion. A
                chess master hiding away from sight would remotely control the machine by electromechanical means,
                tricking unsuspecting players.
            </p>
            <p>
                In modern times, chess engines far outclass even the best of human players. Ironically, the chess
                masters of today are machines.
