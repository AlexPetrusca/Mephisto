                Mephisto is a browser extension that enables next-best-move calculation and automated gameplay on
                Chess.com and Lichess. Getting started with Mephisto is easy!
            </p>

        <div id="usage" class="section scrollspy">
            <h3 class="header">Usage</h3>
            <p>
                Clicking Mephisto's icon will open its popup window and automatically scrape the current page for a
                chess position to analyze.
            </p>
            <h5>Pinning Mephisto</h5>
            <p>
                For ease of use, pin Mephisto in chrome's extensions menu. Click the <i>puzzle</i> icon to the right
                of Chrome's url bar. Find "Mephisto Chess Extension" and click the <i>pin</i> icon to the right of
                it.
            </p>
            <h5>Keeping Mephisto Open</h5>
            <p>
                You may notice that when you click outside of Mephisto's popup window, the popup will lose focus and
                close. To prevent this, right click the pinned icon and click 'Inspect Popup'.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>NOTE</i>: This will keep the popup open until either the inspect window is closed or the current
                tab is changed/closed.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="configuration" class="section big-section scrollspy">
            <h3 class="header">Configuration</h3>
            <p>
                Mephisto supports several modes of operation that can be configured under "Settings/General".
            </p>
            <h5>Best Move</h5>
            <p>
                This is the default mode. Mephisto presents the best move, the opponent's best response to the best
                move, and the Stockfish evaluation for the position. The best move is displayed as a blue arrow
                whereas the opponent's best response is displayed as a red arrow.
            </p>
            <h5>Hand & Brain</h5>
            <p>
                Mephisto presents the Stockfish evaluation for the position and acts as the "Brain", telling you the
                type of the piece to move. From there, it is your job as the "Hand" to find and play the best move
                given the hint.
            </p>
            <h5>Autoplay</h5>
            <p>
                Mephisto calculates the next best move and simulates clicks to play it over the board. By default,
                the simulated clicks are generated directly in browser.
            </p>
            <b>Python Autoplay Backend</b>
            <p>
                If this mode is enabled, click and drag events are performed outside the browser from a Python backend.
                Simulated mouse actions are generated using
                <a href="https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyAutoGUI</a>.
                For this option to work, users must run
                <a href="https://github.com/AlexPetrusca/Mephisto/blob/master/src/scripts/mephisto-clicker.py">mephisto-clicker.py</a>
                locally.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>NOTE</i>: This script will take control of the mouse when activated by Mephisto.
            </p>
            <b>Puzzle Mode</b>
            <p>
                Mephisto optimizes for efficiently solving and automating puzzles. This should be enabled when
                autoplaying puzzle minigames, like Chess.com's Puzzle Rush and Lichess's Puzzle Storm, where a
                player's score depends on solving as many puzzles as possible in a fixed timeframe.
